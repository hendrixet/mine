TIDES

high tide: when that portion of the earth rotates underneat the lunar or solar bulge
low tide: when that portion of the earth is neither under the lunar nor solar bulge

spring tide: the height of the high tide is the combined height of both the lunar and solar bulge
neap tide: the  moon and the sun are at right angles to each other, so it is at an all time low
two week period: amount of time it takes to oscilate between a neap and spring tide 
maximum tidal range: difference between the neap and spring tides' heights 

diurnal tide: 1 high tide and 1 low tide per day
semidiurnal tide: 2 high tides and 2 low tides per day 
mixed tide: 1 high high and 1 high low tide per day, 1 low high and low low tide per ady

amphidromic systems: the coriolis force/effect is the differential velocity of Earth by lattitude
If you go the whole circumference of the earth in 24 at the equator: you go farther than if you travel the entire circumference of the Earth at a higher lattitude 
Anything in motion: is moved by this differential velocity of earth
In the northern hemisphere: anything that is in motion that is not parallel to the equator is turned to the right 
In the southern hemisphere: anything that is in motion that is not parallel to teh equator is turned to the left
what this does: is makes any wave travelling curved 
This is similar: to if you had a bowl of water and you sloshed it around, and the water in the middle stays level but the high point and low point all move around the bowl together at a curve 

Factors: that influence the timing and range of tides
    Earth's tilt
    moon's orbit and gravity 
    sun's orbit and gravity
    basin height

tidal classification: 
    microtidal:
    mesotidal:

Wave character: depends on wind velocity, wind duration, fetch 

typical wave heights: <1m - >30m

in deep water: as the wave moves by, the actual movement of water molecules follow orbital paths that move with the crest of the wave 

in shallow water: the orbital motion turns into elliptical orbit as it drags along the bottom until it eventually crashes
the wave is slowed: from the bottom
the top of the wave: outruns the bottom, and breaks when it outruns the bottom enough
shallow water: is less than half the wave length 
when slowing a wave: height is increased
speed is traded for height: the kinetic energy is turned into potention energy in height and then it is turned back into kinectic energy after it breaks, and hen it does work, eroding away and moving things 

breaks: when h/L >  1/7

spilling wave: gradual wave
plunging wave: greater energy 
surging wave: i.e. a Tsunami, a wall of water, greatest energy 

slope of the bottom: gentle slopes produce spilling waves, and as steepness increases, the waves become more like surging waves 

spilling waves move sand: onshore
plunging waves move sand: 
surging  waves move sand: 

surf zone: zone of breaking waves
swash: surge of water up the beach face

as waves come onshore: they refract/bend, because they slow down differentially
