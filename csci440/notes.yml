Chapter 7: Wireless and Mobile Networks 

two important challenges: 
        1. wireless: communication over wireless link
        2. mobility: handling the mobile user who changes point of attachment to network
wired networks: still exist - at the end of the day, everything is still wired
wireless towers: only receive and send wirelessly, but they are connected to the infrastructure via wired 
problems with wireless:
        1. range
        2. interference
protocol: 802.11
characteristics of selected wireless links: 
        - 4G: 5-11 MBps
        - 3G: ~4   MBps
        - 2G: ~0.5 MBps
handoff:
        1. tries to maintain wireless continuity 
        2. Example: phone connecting to free wireless network
        3. Example: when traveling from work to home, work network > wireless network > home network
indoor protocols: 
        1. bluetooth: 802.11ac
        2. wifi: 802.11n
adhoc network: network between two nodes, similar to peer-to-peer (P2P)
        - EX: sensors that are talking to each other 

single hop: 
        infrastructure: host connects to base station which connects to larger internet
        no infrastructure: no base station, no connection to larger internet 

Bit Error Rate: signal to noise ratio
if you get very good signal: and low nosie, you'll get more flipped bits 
SNR: signal-to-noise ratio
BER: bit-error-rate
larger SNR: easier to extract signal from noise
SNR vs BER tradeoff: 
        given physical layer: increase power > increase SNR > decrease BER
        given SNR: choose physical layer that meets BER requirement given highest throughput
                SNR may change with mobility: dynamically adapt physical layer
Code Division Multiple Acces (CDMA) : 
        1. each user gets a code i.e. 0101
        2. the data is spread across that code i.e. 11
        3. a 'spread' is created by spreading the data across the code then XOR them to receive your spread
        4. i.e. 0101 0101
                1111 0000
            xor 1010 0101
                this is your spread
Over the medium: wave forms are created, the voltages
